// ******* Important Tips - Please Read Carefully Before Running the Program ******* //

// ================================================================================ //

/***
1. Keep at least one image processing window open when running the program to avoid potential FPS drops due to operating system optimization.
***/

/***
2. After starting the program, enter the 'usbstart' command in the terminal to begin USB communication.
   To stop USB communication, enter the 'usbstop' command.
   This allows you to verify the correctness of the HSV values before the controller and servo motors are activated.

/***
